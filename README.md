# Entropy Mastermind game

The game is played by guessing a 4-letter code, and getting feedback on the number of correct positions and correct colors in the guess. The game ends when the player successfully guesses the code or after 10 incorrect guesses.

The script starts by including the necessary libraries, like iostream, string, algorithm and vector, and defines a constant variable MAX_GUESSES which is set to 10.

The script then defines a function called check_guess, which takes two string arguments, guess and code. It compares the guess with the code, checking for the number of correct positions and correct colors. It outputs the number of correct positions and correct colors and return true if the guess is correct.

The script then defines a function called solve_entropy_mastermind, which takes one string argument, code. It creates a vector of guesses and then enters a loop for a maximum of MAX_GUESSES. In each iteration of the loop, it prompts the user to enter a guess and stores it in a variable guess. It then checks for the validity of the guess by ensuring that it is 4 letters long and has not been guessed before. If it is not valid, the iteration is repeated. If the guess is valid, it is stored in the vector of guesses and passed to the check_guess function. If the guess is correct, the user wins and the loop is exited. If the loop completes, the user loses and the script outputs the code.

In the main function, it prompts the user to enter the code to solve and then calls the solve_entropy_mastermind function with the code as an argument.

This script provides a basic implementation of the Entropy Mastermind game and can be modified or extended as needed.
